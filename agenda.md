- Web Server Story Time feat. me
  - BREAD (Browse => GET, Read => GET, Edit => PUT/PATCH, Add => POST, Delete => DELETE)
- Intro to Web Servers (Express-free demo, using `http` module)

--------- Break (10 mins)

- Intro to `express`
- What is "middleware"?
- Intro to server-side view templates with `ejs`

If, for any reason, we have issues with Google Meets, we'll switch to VSCode's audio call option, which I'll set up and share right here if needed. If we have any issues with Plan B - I have a Plan C I can share in the event it's needed. The morale of the story is that lecture is happening and it's going to be a-ok.
